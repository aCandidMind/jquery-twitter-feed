The date-ranges in the below table  represent the time the \r\n   tweet was created, relative to the current time. These ranges are used \r\n   as conditional rules for parsing the dates in their corresponding \r\n   formats. \r\n\r\n   |      Time Since Tweeting        |       Parsed Example       |\r\n   ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   |      1 second - 59 seconds      |       43 seconds ago       |\r\n   |      1 minute - 59 minutes      |       11 minutes ago       |\r\n   |      1 hour   - 23 hours        |       7 hours ago          |\r\n   |      1 day    - XXXXXXXXXX      |       Feb 23 '12           |\r\n\r\n   If these formats are not to your liking, you need only replace the \r\n   parseTweetDate functoin with one of your own.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Optional Link Settings (also applies to date)\r\n   Optional link settings are supplied in object literal form. All of the \r\n   objects representing optional \r\n   link settings have the following properties:\r\n   - show     : if set to true, the link/date is shown (shown by default)\r\n   - class    : CSS class to be applied to the link/date\r\n   - order    : number (zero-based index) indicating when link should be \r\n                rendered in ordering\r\n   - prepend  : HTML markup to be inserted before the link/date\r\n   - append   : HTML markup to be inserted after the link/date\r\n   - link     : indicates whether or not the date should link to the tweet \r\n                (note: effective on date)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis software is protected under the MIT license, below, and under the \r\nOpen Source GPL v3.0 license (http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0).\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Zachary Kniebel\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a \r\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), \r\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\r\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, \r\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the \r\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR \r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, \r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
