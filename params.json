{"name":"jquery-twitter-feed 1.0.1","tagline":"jQuery Twitter Plugin with Twitter API 1.1 Support","body":"# Twitter Feed v1.1.0\r\nby Zachary Kniebel\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter Feed is a robust and highly customizable jQuery Twitter plugin for \r\nrendering tweets passed as JSON objects. The plugin was designed with\r\nperformance and simplicity in mind, and is completely compatible with \r\nTwitter's API 1.1* (more details, below). The plugin includes several \r\nexamples, including the server-side code necessary for making requests to \r\nTwitter, written in both C# and PHP. For those using .NET, Twitter Feed \r\nalso comes with the initial commit of my new C# Twitter library, TweetNET. \r\nMore details on TweetNET may be found, below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TWITTER API 1.1 UPDATE NOTES:\r\n   As a result of the new security and authorization requirements that   \r\n   Twitter included in their API 1.1 update, the support for performing \r\n   the actual AJAX request to retrieve a user's tweets has been removed.\r\n   Twitter strongly discourages client-side requests with their new API,\r\n   as client-side requests would require the exposure of the site's oAuth\r\n   secrets. As such, I have included support for supplying a the raw, \r\n   unparsed JSON response from Twitter to the plugin, and have provided\r\n   both instructions and samples for setting up the necessary account and \r\n   application on Twitter, and implementing the plugin with .NET and with \r\n   PHP. For updates and instructions, see the SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS file in\r\n   the Server-Side Examples directory.\r\n   \r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n   - Ability to show/hide Reply, Retweet and Favorite (all shown by \r\n     default)\r\n   - Ability to show/hide Date of tweet - can also be set to link to the \r\n     tweet (shown and rendered as link by default)\r\n   - Ability to supply markup to be inserted be inserted before or after \r\n     any optional links/date\r\n   - Ability to set the order in which optional links will/date be \r\n     displayed\r\n   - Ability to supply a CSS class to any text/markup rendered, including \r\n     the tweet body and all optional links/date\r\n   - Ability to specify callback function to be called either when the \r\n     function completes, or when each tweet is rendered\r\n     - note that any callbacks called when the fuction completes will be \r\n       called before the tweet is done loading (AJAX)\r\n   - Ability to specify number of tweets to display\r\n   \r\n\r\n## Twitter Feed Options Object\r\n   - count            : the number of tweets to display\r\n   - rawData          : the JSON result of the tweet request made to \r\n                        Twitter (string) \r\n   - prepend          : markup to insert before the tweet \r\n   - append           : markup to insert after the tweet\r\n   - tweetBodyClass   : a CSS class applied to the body of each retrieved \r\n                        tweet\r\n   - date             : an object representing optional link settings (see \r\n                        Dates and Optional Link Settings)\r\n   - reply            : an object representing optional link settings (see \r\n                        Optional Link Settings)\r\n   - retweet          : an object representing optional link settings (see \r\n                        Optional Link Settings)\r\n   - favorite         : an object representing optional link settings (see \r\n                        Optional Link Settings)\r\n   - callbackOnEach   : if true, the supplied callback function will be \r\n                        called after each tweet is loaded\r\n   - callback         : an optional callback function to be called after \r\n                        each or all tweet(s) have loaded\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dates\r\n   The plugin's included parseTweetDate function parses dates based based \r\n   on when the tweet was created, similar to the way Twitter does on their \r\n   own site. The date-ranges in the below table  represent the time the \r\n   tweet was created, relative to the current time. These ranges are used \r\n   as conditional rules for parsing the dates in their corresponding \r\n   formats. \r\n   \r\n      [Time Since Tweeting] :    [Parsed Example]\r\n      \r\n       1 second - 59 seconds :    43 seconds ago  \r\n       1 minute - 59 minutes :    11 minutes ago  \r\n       1 hour   - 23 hours   :    7 hours ago  \r\n       1 day    - XXXXXXXXXX :    Feb 23 '12 \r\n\r\n   If these formats are not to your liking, you need only replace the \r\n   parseTweetDate functoin with one of your own.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Optional Link Settings (also applies to date)\r\n   Optional link settings are supplied in object literal form. All of the \r\n   objects representing optional \r\n   link settings have the following properties:\r\n   - show     : if set to true, the link/date is shown (shown by default)\r\n   - cssClass : CSS class to be applied to the link/date\r\n   - order    : number (zero-based index) indicating when link should be \r\n                rendered in ordering\r\n   - prepend  : HTML markup to be inserted before the link/date\r\n   - append   : HTML markup to be inserted after the link/date\r\n   - link     : indicates whether or not the date should link to the tweet \r\n                (note: effective on date)\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n## TweetNET (initial release, only)\r\n   TweetNET is a work-in-progress library that I am working on, to better\r\n   assist developers in connecting with Twitter via C#. TweetNET IS NOT \r\n   REQUIRED for Twitter Feed, but may be useful for those using C# or\r\n   .NET, in general. I have included only the initial release in this \r\n   project, and will only be updating with bug fixes. The initial release\r\n   includes support for the statuses/user_timeline and statuses/show/:id\r\n   requests. For future releases, please view TweetNET's official \r\n   repository, at https://github.com/zkniebel/TweetNet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n## VERSION AND RELEASE NOTES:\r\n\r\n-- added TweetNET v1.0 --\r\n\r\n-- merged v1.1 into master --\r\n\r\nv1.1.0 \r\n    - Major modern browsers, IE7+ support\r\n    - Improvements to method of ordering optional links\r\n    - Updated support for parsing JSON in IE7 and earlier\r\n\t\r\n-- created branch for v1.1 --\r\n-- created branch for v1.0 (version backup) --\r\n\r\nv1.0.2 (not named in commit comment)\r\n    - (Initial Commit: 2deb4ec6f1aacfc92b178f7e1f11b8b9dae39298)\r\n    - Major modern browsers, IE9+ support\r\n    - Improvements, optimizations and tweaks post Twitter API 1.1 update\r\n    - Example plugin call\r\n\t\r\nv1.0.1 (beta):\r\n    - Major modern browsers, IE9+ support\r\n    - Twitter API 1.1 support\r\n    - Server-side examples, improved documentation\r\n\r\nv1.0 (alpha):\r\n    - Major modern browsers, IE7+ support\r\n    - Twitter API 1.0 support\r\n\t\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis software is protected under the MIT license, below, and under the \r\nOpen Source GPL v3.0 license (http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0).\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Zachary Kniebel\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a \r\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), \r\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\r\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, \r\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the \r\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR \r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, \r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
