Twitter Feed
by Zachary Kniebel


Twitter Feed is a robust and highly customizable jQuery Twitter plugin for 
retrieving the latest tweets of a specified Twitter user's timeline. The 
plugin provides support reply, retweet and favorite links, as well as the 
date of the tweet. 


TWITTER API 1.1 UPDATE NOTES:
   As a result of the new security and authorization requirements that   
   Twitter included in their API 1.1 update, the support for performing 
   the actual AJAX request to retrieve a user's tweets has been removed.
   Twitter strongly discourages client-side requests with their new API,
   as client-side requests would require the exposure of the site's oAuth
   secrets. As such, I have included support for supplying a the raw, 
   unparsed JSON response from Twitter to the plugin, and have provided
   both instructions and samples for setting up the necessary account and 
   application on Twitter, and implementing the plugin with .NET and with 
   PHP. For updates and instructions, see the SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS file in
   the Server-Side Examples directory.
   

Features:
   - Ability to show/hide Reply, Retweet and Favorite (all shown by 
     default)
   - Ability to show/hide Date of tweet - can also be set to link to the 
     tweet (shown and rendered as link by default)
   - Ability to supply markup to be inserted be inserted before or after 
     any optional links/date
   - Ability to set the order in which optional links will/date be 
     displayed
   - Ability to supply a CSS class to any text/markup rendered, including 
     the tweet body and all optional links/date
   - Ability to specify callback function to be called either when the 
     function completes, or when each tweet is rendered
     - note that any callbacks called when the fuction completes will be 
       called before the tweet is done loading (AJAX)
   - Ability to specify number of tweets to display
   

Twitter Feed Options Object
   - count            : the number of tweets to display

                        Dates and Optional Link Settings)
   - reply            : an object representing optional link settings (see

                        called after each tweet is loaded
   - callback         : an optional callback function to be called after 
                        each or all tweet(s) have loaded


 Dates
   The plugin's included parseTweetDate function parses dates based based 
   on when the tweet was created, similar to the way Twitter does on their 
   own site. The date-ranges in the below table  represent the time the 
   tweet was created, relative to the current time. These ranges are used 
   as conditional rules for parsing the dates in their corresponding 
   formats. 
   
      [Time Since Tweeting] :    [Parsed Example]
      
       1 second - 59 seconds :    43 seconds ago  
       1 minute - 59 minutes :    11 minutes ago  
       1 hour   - 23 hours   :    7 hours ago  
       1 day    - XXXXXXXXXX :    Feb 23 '12 

   If these formats are not to your liking, you need only replace the 
   parseTweetDate functoin with one of your own.


Optional Link Settings (also applies to date)
   Optional link settings are supplied in object literal form. All of the 
   objects representing optional 
   link settings have the following properties:
   - show     : if set to true, the link/date is shown (shown by default)
   - cssClass : CSS class to be applied to the link/date
   - order    : number (zero-based index) indicating when link should be 
                rendered in ordering
   - prepend  : HTML markup to be inserted before the link/date
   - append   : HTML markup to be inserted after the link/date
   - link     : indicates whether or not the date should link to the tweet 
                (note: effective on date)
